## The Shirt

Many moons ago I saw this on a t-shirt on Twitter and loved it. My wife, noticing my reaction, would later surprise me with one of my own.

At the time she had it custom made for me. I'm not certain if the link below is the same seller but it's certainly the same design. Looks great, comfortable fit and an excellent ice-breaker for incident calls.

Update: Sorry - this product is no longer available at amazon. If you got one while it was you now have a collectors item.
