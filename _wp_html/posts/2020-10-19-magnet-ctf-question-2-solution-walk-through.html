<p><strong><em>Challenge 2 (OCT 12-18) PIP Install: What domain was most&nbsp;recently viewed via an app that has picture-in-picture capability?</em></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>For the week 2 challenge, we’re using the same Android image&nbsp;we examined last week. From the question there’s two factors involved,&nbsp;application capability and application usage.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first thing to understand is what applications on the&nbsp;device have PIP (Picture in Picture) capability.</p>

<p>I reviewed the installed applications on the device looking&nbsp;for anything that could be PIP related. A screen recording application caught&nbsp;my attention (googled to understand capability), but <strong><em>this was not the ‘Droid (app)&nbsp;we’re looking for.</em></strong></p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One of the Discord users shared this helpful link describing&nbsp;the capability and what applications featured PIP support.</p>

<p>Back to the applications I tagged anything listed that&nbsp;showed up in the PIP article.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>From here I proceeded to look at the <strong>Application&nbsp;Activity – Android.</strong>&nbsp; One of the applications we can see recent activity for is Google Chrome. From the previously referenced article we know this app supports PIP.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the preview card we can see that it was captured that&nbsp;<strong>Chrome</strong> was used to visit a URL beginning with <strong>MallieSae.com.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The artifact for this can be found at <strong>MUS_Android.tar\data\system_ce\0\snapshots\320.jpg</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><span style="text-decoration:underline;">Answer</span>: Google Chrome, an&nbsp;app that supports PIP, was recently used visit the domain malliesae.com</p>
