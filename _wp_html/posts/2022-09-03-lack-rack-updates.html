<p>I have a tendency for DIY projects to never be finished. Actually that's not entirely true. I finish them, but then I continue to build/expand on them.  This has been true of many elements of my home office since moving to our home two years ago. A few months back I posted my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2022/02/28/diy-home-network-rack-the-lack-rack/" target="_blank">DIY network rack built from IKEA end tables</a>. A week or so later LED's were added.  I have several automation routines that will change the LED color based on status conditions.</p>

<p>The rack has served me very well so far, but I wanted to make a few improvements. Previously I had laptop (on riser stand) and a portable (15" usb-C) monitor on the top. The monitor (and wireless keyboard) is connected an Intel NUC inside the rack that dual boots between REMnux and Windows11.</p>

<p>I wanted to make room for a full size monitor on top, but I was running low on real estate. A couple orders later on amazon and I had exactly what I wanted.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First I added a dual-arm stand that could accommodate a full size monitor (24" fits well here), and a second arm that supports a laptop. I wound up replacing the monitor arm mount with a different mount that kept it closer to the support pole (the screen was a little too 'in the face' before that.) Since the composition materials of the Ikea tables are likely MDF, I added a steel panels on the top and bottom of the clamp for extra durability.</p>

<p>The height is perfect for a standing workstation. If I need to work on the laptop, there is enough free space to open and operate fully without impacting the monitor. </p>

<p>So here it is, the [updated] "Lack Rack" finished... for now.</p>
