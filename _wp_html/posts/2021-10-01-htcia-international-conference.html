<p>I had the fortunate opportunity of presenting to the 2021 HTCIA (High Tech Crime Investigators Association) this week. I'd originally hoped to attend in person but we've still got travel restrictions in place so it was virtual attendance for me. There was a lot of good speakers and content through the week (triggering my imposter syndrome more and more as the week went on) ;)  In the end I think it went off pretty well. Somehow I managed to see around the "screen sharing" label that for whatever reason (narrator: it was nerves) that I never dismissed.</p>

<p>I don't know yet if the recordings will remain available after the conference, however I promised to share my <a href="https://github.com/dwmetz/CSIRT-Collect/blob/main/HTCIA_Powershell.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slides</a> from the event so if you'd like to review, head on over to the <a href="https://github.com/dwmetz/CSIRT-Collect/blob/main/HTCIA_Powershell.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> and grab a copy. While you're there check out the main feature of my presentation - <a href="https://github.com/dwmetz/CSIRT-Collect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CSIRT-Collect</a>.</p>
