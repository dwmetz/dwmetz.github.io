<p>I've made some updates to the Mal-Hash PowerShell script. Most notable is that the script now works (via PowerShell) on <strong>Windows, Mac and Linux</strong>.</p>

<p>The script takes the input of a file, calculates the hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256), and then submits the <strong><em>HASH</em></strong> to Virus Total for analysis. The script will also run Strings against the sample. The hashes, strings and Virus Total results are both displayed on screen and saved to a text report. Timestamp of the analysis is recorded in UTC.</p>
