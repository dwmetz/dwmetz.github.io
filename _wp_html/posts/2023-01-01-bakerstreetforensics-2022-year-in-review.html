<p>Happy New Year to all the readers. 2022 was a handful, but there were a lot of things to celebrate. I completed my first full year as an employee of Magnet Forensics. Between the people I work with, and the satisfaction of the mission, I couldn't be happier with where I'm at.</p>

<p>The first blog post of the year, <strong><a href="https://wordpress.com/post/bakerstreetforensics.com/622">QuickPcap â€“ Capturing a PCAP with PowerShell</a></strong>, wound up being the most popular post of the year and a repeat traffic driver. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2021/05/26/adding-sift-and-remnux-to-your-windows-forensics-environment/" target="_blank">Adding SIFT and REMnux to your Windows Forensics environment</a> would have to concede to being #2 after a very long run. </p>

<p>though it wouldn't be til <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2022/09/08/lack-rack-part-iii-the-final-chapter/" target="_blank">September</a> that I called an end to the "one more thing" adjustments. It's definitely one of my favorite DIY projects to date.</p>

<p>There were lots of little successes as well, like finally cleaning up and re-organizing my 'go-bag.'</p>

<p>As my focus has been more concentrated on malware investigation and analysis - that meant that in no time there'd be something I could automate with PowerShell, and so came <strong>Mal-Hash</strong>. A few months after the initial release, I was able to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2022/12/06/mal-hash-ps1-v1-3-update/" target="_blank">update</a> it. Included in the refinements was the ability to now run the script on Windows, Mac, and Linux (via PowerShell). </p>

<p>I also went back to all my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2022/11/20/group-collections-from-o365-with-powershell/" target="_blank">O365 related PowerShell Scripts</a> and updated them all to support the latest modern auth / MFA protocols from Microsoft.</p>

<p>After several years of Covid isolation, I was back to attending and presenting at conferences. This year I was able to participate in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/?page_id=1008" target="_blank">Magnet User Summit</a></p>
