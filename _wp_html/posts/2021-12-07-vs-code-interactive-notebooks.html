<p><strong>Note before installing</strong>:<br><em>As your scripts and notebooks develop, there is a likelihood that you will want to run some either as Administrator or using another user credential. One way to do so simply launch VS code (right click) as Admin, or use the Run As feature when you launch the application.</em></p>
