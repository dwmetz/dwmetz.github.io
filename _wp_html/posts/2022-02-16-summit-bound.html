<p>January 2020, the last time I had work related travel, seems like an eon ago. Later that year I had planned my first attendance at the Magnet User Summit in Nashville. Then COVID entered the scene and every event going forward for me was remote only. Don't get me wrong, I'm an introvert and being able to work from home in my fortress of solitude the past few years has been great. I even managed to present at Magnet Enterprise Pulse and the HTCIA International Summit, both remotely. Fast forward to the present and events are starting to open back up. </p>

<p>The Magnet User Summit in April will be supporting in-person and virtual attendance. After two years as virtual participant I'll finally be able to attend in person. As it turns out I'll be presenting at the conference as well! It's taken me a few years to get here, but now I get to attend as a speaker (and and employee!)</p>
