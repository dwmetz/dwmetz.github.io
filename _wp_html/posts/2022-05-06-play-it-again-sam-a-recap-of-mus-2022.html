<p>I had a wonderful time participating in the Magnet User Summit, both in person and virtually. After 2 years of participating virtually, it was my first time attending the Summit in person. It was great to meet for the first time in person, not just many of my coworkers, but many of the regulars in my Twitter stream as well. What a gathering of brilliant, yet equally humble, investigators.</p>

<p>During the Summit I participated on a panel about <em>Bringing your Forensics Lab to the Cloud.</em> I also had fun co-presenting on two talks, <em>Walkthrough of a BEC (Business Email Compromise) </em>and. <em>Walkthrough of a Ransomware Investigation</em>, where we looked at the examinations from a Law Enforcement and from a corporate perspective.</p>

<p>There was the surreal moment of realizing that the boss doesn't just rock, <em>he ROCKS</em>!</p>

<p>This year there was an in person and a virtual CTF with separate evidence and challenges. For the in-person CTF we examined a Linux laptop and an iPhone.<em> Also, the long anticipated Dark Mode is a treat for the retinas.</em></p>

<p>For the virtual CTF the evidence sources were a Windows image and an Android mobile device, and a Google TakeOut. I surprised myself with how well I did on the Android and that hasn't been my area of expertise.</p>
