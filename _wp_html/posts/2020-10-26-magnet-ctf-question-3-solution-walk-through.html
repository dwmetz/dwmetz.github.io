<p>In NJ it’s common to inquire where someone resides with the question “What exit?” I found it interesting that some of the test data examined as part of the CTF included artifacts that <em>originated </em>in New Jersey. Yup. I hail from the land of Bruce Springsteen and Bon Jovi and if you even mention Jersey Shore in the context of a <em>reality </em>show, please just… quietly go away.</p>

<p>Many types of forensic artifacts include metadata that ties that evidence to a particular location using GPS data. Maps and driving applications are among these, and commonly you can retrieve this data from photos and videos. (Note: a lot of services Facebook, Instagram, etc. – will have settings on whether or not they remove this data when media is shared.)</p>

<p>Selecting this view limits the presentation of artifacts to just those that include GPS data.</p>

<p>Reviewing the artifacts with GPS metadata there was nothing that immediately presented as a reference to&nbsp;<em>exit</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>cargo</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>However, just like Transformers, within these artifacts there is more than meets the eye. In the screenshot above you’ll see that several files start with MVIMG_ . These files are Google Motion Photos, essentially the functional equivalent of Live Photos on iOS.</p>

<p>A few weeks back I saw a Magnet webinar: Mobile Artifact Comparison – Understanding the Similarities Between iOS and Android Data</p>

<p>Included in the comparison were both of these “live photo” types and <a href="https://twitter.com/b1n2h3x">B1n2h3x</a> reference that previously she had carved out the MVIMG_ files and was able to isolate the key frame and the MP4 image (video) that comprised it.</p>

<ul><li>Using Axiom, I exported all the MVIMG_ files to a folder.</li><li>Next I utilized GoMoPho - Google motion photos video extractor&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/cliveontoast/GoMoPho">https://github.com/cliveontoast/GoMoPho</a> and ran it against the directory which split the MVIMG_ files into .jpg and .mp4</li><li>From there I loaded the videos into VLC.&nbsp;&nbsp;They were only a few seconds long and played very fast. This is where the playback speed settings in VLC come in handy. Drop it back to the slowest it will play.</li></ul>

<p>When initially previewed, MVIMG_20200307_120326.jpg presented what appeared as a view from the highway in winter. There are no immediate discernable landmarks in the photo.</p>

<p>However, when the extracted video is played, we get a few seconds visibility from the car on the highway, including passing the following sign:</p>

<p>Among the words on the sign we can read “Cargo” and the exit show at the bottom of the sign, <strong>F16</strong>.</p>
