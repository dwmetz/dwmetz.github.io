<p>I have an obsession with mini computers. I've got a number of NUCs as lab devices, and some off brand models too. There is also not quite a bakery's worth of Raspberry Pi's. Having small purpose driven appliances works perfectly for how my lab setup has evolved. As needs and missions change, different components can be repurposed and built into something else. In a way it's like playing with Legos; another proclivity I've held on to from my earliest days as a tinkerer.</p>

<p>One of my favorite (and ever evolving) projects has been the <a href="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/tag/lack-rack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lack Rack</a>. I'd already had a set of Raspberry Pi's rack <a href="https://a.co/d/1ybCBI1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mounted</a>. </p>

<p>As I was rewiring some other components, I rack <a href="https://a.co/d/69thtsY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mounted</a> 2 NUCs and improvised on a third pc. There was another mini computer that I was looking to mount, but the dimensions weren't compatible with the rack hardware. That led to a separate project that worked out so well I figured I'd share it.</p>

<p>There's really only one component to the build, though you could use multiple kits depending on how many levels (or computers) you want to accommodate. The <a href="https://a.co/d/aEHB6XX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kit</a> isn't Lego brand, but it's essentially interchangeable with other Lego pieces.</p>

<p>The (4) base plates are 6x6 and come with (30) 2 inch risers.  As such the shelves can be 2 or 4 inches between. I used the risers not just for the corner posts, but also on the sides of the devices to fix them in position. Besides mini computers it was very easy to accommodate a <a href="https://a.co/d/3D4bcmj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5-port switch</a> for networking. </p>

<p>If you're looking for an easy way to rack and stack a few mini computers, and perhaps want to add some Lego accoutrements, this could be just what you need.</p>
