    <p>This weeks challenge was another round of memory forensics. As with the previous weeks challenge most* of my solves were done using a REMnux VM. REMnux includes both Volatility 2.61 (SSL support deprecated) and the beta of Volatility 3.</p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge 10, Part 1: At the time of the RAM collection (20-Apr-20 23:23:26- Imageinfo) there was an established connection to a Google Server. What was the Remote IP address and port number? format: “xxx.xxx.xx.xxx:xxx”</em></strong></p>

<p>Using the <strong>netscan</strong> plugin for Volatility and then filtering for “established” we see 4 open connections. A whois lookup on the addresses indicates that 172.253.188 is affiliated with Google. The communications were traversing port 443.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flag-1-and-2.png?w=1024" alt="" />Flag 1: <strong>172.253.63.188:443</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge 10, Part 2: What was the Local IP address and port number? same format as part 1</em></strong></p>

<p>Looking at our earlier output from netscan we see the source address was <strong>192.168.10.146:54282</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flag-2.png?w=1024" alt="" />Flag 2: <strong>192.168.10.146:54282</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge 10, Part 3: What was the URL?</em></strong></p>

<p>So we know we’ve got an open connection to a remote host going on at the time the memory was captured. Looking at Passive DNS for the Google IP address I could see that it’s principally been associated with Google Chat related assets.</p>

<p>I ran the memory sample through Bulk Extractor to carve out a PCAP of any of the networking artifacts that were present in the image.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/be-to-pcap.png?w=1024" alt="" />bulk_extractor to pcap</p>

<p>Once the pcap was carved I opened it with Wireshark.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/wireshark-open.png?w=1024" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking through the pcap we see that the client computer had received a DNS response for mtalk.google.com at 172.253.63.188</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/pcap.png?w=1024" alt="" /></p>

<p>The question was looking for a URL so… <strong>https://mtalk.google.com</strong> - yes! [Flag 3]. <em>Originally this answer wasn’t accepted. I later received an email that it was accepted as an alternate solution and to resubmit</em>.</p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge 10, Part 4: What user was responsible for this activity based on the profile?</em></strong></p>

<p>The <strong>getsids</strong> Volatility plugin quickly yields the active user account.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/getsids.png?w=1024" alt="" />Flag 4: <strong>Warren</strong></p>

<p><strong><em>Challenge 10, Part 5: How long was this user looking at this browser with this version of Chrome? *format: X:XX:XX.XXXXX * Hint: down to the last second</em></strong></p>

<p>This one had me stumped for a while. I first tried calculating the delta between when the chrome process was started to the time the image was acquired. (Nope)</p>

<p>Eventually I succumbed and took the hint which had to do with “FOCUS”. Another clue that I’d heard on Discord was that this was ‘VERY easy to solve in Axiom.’</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/focus.png?w=1024" alt="" /></p>

<p>Sure enough, stacking filters for Chrome and Focus and restricting the search to the Memory evidence yields a Registy artifact indicating that the focus time for Chrome was 3:36:47.301000. Oh but don’t just copy paste here without checking the question for the flag format. There’s only 5 places after the last decimal. So for Flag 5 the answer is <strong>3:36:47.30100</strong>.</p>

<p>I was victorious in getting all 5 flags, but this has been just as much about learning as it has been about the friendly competition. So now that I knew the answer and where relatively it could be found in the evidence, I wanted to see if I could solve it just with REMnux as I had the other challenge elements.</p>

<p>I ran the <strong>timeliner</strong> Volatility plugin and exported the output file to .xlsx. format.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/timeliner.png?w=1024" alt="" /></p>

<p>This took a few minutes to process. Once complete, I opened timeliner.xlsx.</p>

<p><img src="https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/flag5-excel.png?w=1024" alt="" />Flag 5 (alternate) 3:36:47.30100</p>

<p>If we filter the <strong>Item</strong> column for <em>Chrome</em> and the <strong>Details</strong> column for <em>Focus</em> - there again the same result - <strong>3:36:47.30100</strong>. <em>Don’t forget to drop the last zero for the Flag.</em></p>
