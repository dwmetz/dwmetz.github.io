You can now get Baker Street Forensics swag, everything from shirts and stickers to onesies and pillows. I'm especially fond of the notebooks. I worked with a number of independent artists to commission a few new logo designs. This is where I need your help. 

  1. What's your favorite of the designs? The winner will be the default logo for bakerstreetforensics.com 
  2. All proceeds from the sales will be donated to charity. Do you have a charity you'd like to nominate? The charity with the most votes will receive the proceeds.
