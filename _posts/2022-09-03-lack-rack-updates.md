I have a tendency for DIY projects to never be finished. Actually that's not entirely true. I finish them, but then I continue to build/expand on them. This has been true of many elements of my home office since moving to our home two years ago. A few months back I posted my [DIY network rack built from IKEA end tables](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/2022/02/28/diy-home-network-rack-the-lack-rack/). A week or so later LED's were added. I have several automation routines that will change the LED color based on status conditions.

The rack has served me very well so far, but I wanted to make a few improvements. Previously I had laptop (on riser stand) and a portable (15" usb-C) monitor on the top. The monitor (and wireless keyboard) is connected an Intel NUC inside the rack that dual boots between REMnux and Windows11.

I wanted to make room for a full size monitor on top, but I was running low on real estate. A couple orders later on amazon and I had exactly what I wanted.

First I added a dual-arm stand that could accommodate a full size monitor (24" fits well here), and a second arm that supports a laptop. I wound up replacing the monitor arm mount with a different mount that kept it closer to the support pole (the screen was a little too 'in the face' before that.) Since the composition materials of the Ikea tables are likely MDF, I added a steel panels on the top and bottom of the clamp for extra durability.

  * Steel reinforcement panels: [https://a.co/d/](https://a.co/d/dbIocDr)[dbIocDr](https://a.co/d/dbIocDr)



The height is perfect for a standing workstation. If I need to work on the laptop, there is enough free space to open and operate fully without impacting the monitor. 

So here it is, the [updated] "Lack Rack" finished... for now.
