I only managed to get half the solution to last weeks challenge.

Finding the first half of the solution was pretty straight-forward.

In the File system view (or via your image mounting directory traversal of choice) navigate to **\var\log\apt.**

Here we find the **history.log** file which keeps track of applications installed via apt.

If you scroll to the end of the log you can see that a lot of packages were installed or upgraded on 2017-11-08. From there on we have no (logged) activity until 2019-10-07 when **php** [Flag] is installed.

Part 2 I'm afraid eluded me. I'm looking forward to seeing the other write-ups to see the solve for the **Why?**
