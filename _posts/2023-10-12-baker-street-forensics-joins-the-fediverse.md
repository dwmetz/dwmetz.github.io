Just about a year ago I switched my default social platform of choice to Mastodon and created an account at [Infosec.Exchange](https://infosec.exchange/). If you'd like to follow me there directly, [here](https://infosec.exchange/@dwmetz) is my profile.

## What's the Fediverse?

In short, it's a network of networks, without a central control, using open standards to communicate.

## Baker Street Forensics joins the Feds ;)

Recently I learned that [WordPress.com blogs can now be followed on Mastodon and other federated platforms](https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/11/wordpress-com-blogs-can-now-be-followed-on-mastodon-and-other-federated-platforms/). 

> By using the plug-in, blog owners have the potential to reach more followers as theyâ€™ll be able to share their posts to other platforms and, in turn, receive replies from those platforms that are transformed into blog comments.

If you're on Mastodon and/or the Fediverse, please give a follow to "**bakerstreetforensics.com@bakerstreetforensics.com** ".

If it works, _you my faithful readers are the beta-testers_ , you should be able to see future posts by following this account. Additionally, comments via Mastodon _should_ be visible here. 

_What do you think about this functionality? How are you consuming or engaging with content in the Fediverse?_
