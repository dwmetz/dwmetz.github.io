## Backdoored Splunk

Hit Start.

So we've got a url and a specific port. Firefox web browser yields...

So we need an Authorization header. ðŸ¤”

Time to look at the provided files. It looks to be the export of a Splunk application.

Time to download an eval copy of Splunk and... pause. There's probably a simpler way to attack this.

[The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) is a command line tool I picked up during the CTF and I love it. It's like Grep on PCP.

Once installed, the base command is ag, followed by what you're searching for, and where. So let's do a quick search for Authorization on all the contents of this directory.

That looks interesting. A clue? One of the PowerShell scripts has **_Authorization_** and what looks to be Base64 code.

We also see a comment about the $PORT being dynamic based on the Start button. Decoding the string in CyberChef...

At this point we have all the pieces, we just need to put them together. I started to look at different ways to pass an Authorization header to a web server. There's proxy tools galore. And then there's the basic's like curl. After a bit of brushing up on my syntax I had: 
    
    
    curl -H "Authorization: Basic [longStringFromThePowershell]" http://site:$PORT

Yay what looks like more Base64. Once more with our Chef's hat and...

## Traffic

[rita](https://github.com/activecm/rita) was a tool I hadn't used before but it was very easy to use. I installed it on my REMnux box and then ran it against the dataset.

![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-05-at-9.00.44e280afam.png?w=1000)

I then used the command to generate an html report.

Looking through the DNS requests there's something sketchy indeed.

Let's go take a look at that.

## Dumpster Fire

![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-12.08.35e280afpm.png?w=1024)

Let's start with the_silver_searcher again and see if we have any luck with "Password".

![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-08-at-12.27.45e280afpm.png?w=581) ![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-08-at-12.26.51e280afpm.png?w=1024)

There's a number of hits including references to an _**encryptedUsername**_ and _**encryptedPassword**_ in the logins.json file. So we've got some encrypted Firefox user passwords. If only there were a utility that could decrypt those. Enter [firepwd.py](https://github.com/lclevy/firepwd#firepwdpy), an open source tool to decrypt Mozilla protected passwords.

Run the script in Python and point it to the directory for the user profile (where the logins.json file is).

![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-09-at-12.25.09e280afpm.png?w=1024) ![](https://bakerstreetforensics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/screenshot-2023-10-08-at-12.48.26e280afpm.png?w=1024)

That's a pretty LEET password ;)
